# Default locale for standard Rails internalization

# Default locale in Rails 2.2.2 is <tt>:en</tt>

# All the strings in Rails 2.2.2 are localized, see eg. <tt>activerecord/lib/active_record/locale/en.yml</tt>
# See http://github.com/rails/rails/tree/2-2-stable/activerecord%2Flib%2Factive_record%2Flocale%2Fen.yml

# You essentially "override" this localization in your own locale files

# See www.rails-i18n.org for more information about Rails i18n

    # Static texts
    :time_and_date_formats => 'You can also make use of defined <em>time and date formats</em>:'
